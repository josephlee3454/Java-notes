## application overveiw
* Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages. The Android SDK tools compile your code along with any data and resource files into an APK, an Android package, which is an archive file with an .apk suffix. One APK file contains all the contents of an Android app and is the file that Android-powered devices use to install the app.


## own Security 


* The Android operating system is a multi-user Linux system in which each app is a different user.
* By default, the system assigns each app a unique Linux user ID (the ID is used only by the system and is unknown to the app). The system sets permissions for all the files in an app so that only the user ID assigned to that app can access them.
* Each process has its own virtual machine (VM), so an app's code runs in isolation from other apps.
* By default, every app runs in its own Linux process. The Android system starts the process when any of the app's components need to be executed, and then shuts down the process when it's no longer needed or when the system must recover memory for other apps.



## 4 different app Components 
* Activities
* Services
* Broadcast receivers
* Content providers


## Activities 
#### An activity is the entry point for interacting with the user. It represents a single screen with a user interface.


* Keeping track of what the user currently cares about (what is on screen) to ensure that the system keeps running the process that is hosting the activity.
* Knowing that previously used processes contain things the user may return to (stopped activities), and thus more highly prioritize keeping those processes around.
* Helping the app handle having its process killed so the user can return to activities with their previous state restored.
* Providing a way for apps to implement user flows between each other, and for the system to coordinate these flows. (The most classic example here being share.)

## Services 
#### A service is a general-purpose entry point for keeping an app running in the background for all kinds of reasons. It is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes. A service does not provide a user interface.
* Music playback is something the user is directly aware of, so the app tells the system this by saying it wants to be foreground with a notification to tell the user about it; in this case the system knows that it should try really hard to keep that service's process running, because the user will be unhappy if it goes away.
* A regular background service is not something the user is directly aware as running, so the system has more freedom in managing its process. It may allow it to be killed (and then restarting the service sometime later) if it needs RAM for things that are of more immediate concern to the user.


## Broadcast recivers
#### A broadcast receiver is a component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements


## Content Providers
#### A content provider manages a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access. Through the content provider, other apps can query or modify the data if the content provider allows it.

* Assigning a URI doesn't require that the app remain running, so URIs can persist after their owning apps have exited. The system only needs to make sure that an owning app is still running when it has to retrieve the app's data from the corresponding URI.
* These URIs also provide an important fine-grained security model. For example, an app can place the URI for an image it has on the clipboard, but leave its content provider locked up so that other apps cannot freely access it. When a second app attempts to access that URI on the clipboard, the system can allow that app to access the data via a temporary URI permission grant so that it is allowed to access the data only behind that URI, but nothing else in the second app.
