# Loops and things 

## Def:

#### looping is a feature which facilitates theb execution of a set of instructions until the control boolean expression evaluates to false 


## Def:
* a for loop is a control structure that allows for (incrementing and us to reoeat certain operations by incrementing and evauluating a loop counter 
## Example:


### for (intilize, bool, step statement)


* Before the first iteration, the loop counter gets initialized, then the condition evaluation is performed followed by the step definition (usually a simple incrementation).



### for (int i = o ;i<15; i++)



## def
*  The while loop is Java's most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true.

# While (bool statement)

* The loop's Boolean-expression is evaluated before the first iteration of the loop
### int l = 0;
### while ( i < 5){
### System.out.println("your greater than 5 ")



## def 
* The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop
### do {
 ###   statement;
### } while (bool expression );
