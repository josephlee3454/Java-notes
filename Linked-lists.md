# Fun !!! with linked lists



* Linked List: is a dsa that uses nodes to hold peices of data. Whats unique about it is rather then somthing like an array that holds dedicated pieces of data in a collection thats packed together it is basically held on toeach other in memeory how we tell it 

* now there is two types of Linked list dsas that we know. singly only one reference doubbly two references what does this mean well this means that in doubly it doesnt just use next as a reference it also uses previous as a reference as well.

* Next , Head , Cur all refernces that we can create to describe our linked list. we use next to get the next  node from the head or you use to get the next of next wierd right well its pretty dope when you try it. Head refernces the front of the linked list. cur is basically what to use to keep a firm hold on your head or head.next... etc.  in linked list it is very easy to loose a node because it is based off of being held by refernces that you created. for example if you need the to work with head then you initilize the cur to be the head and curr is what you would work with. 

* So the best practice if looping is to use a for loop at least on creation because its not like an array that you can just find the length of it and then your gucci you need to use a conditional loop to go through it.
